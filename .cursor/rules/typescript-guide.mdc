# General AI Instructions

When generating or refactoring code the AI assistant must:

*   **Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes where possible.**
*   **If there is not a markdown files with the plan for the current prompt, always start a task by creating a plan and writing that plan to a markdown file.**
*   **When completing a prompt, if you are following a plan always revisit the plan to verify you have completed the step you were asked to complete and update the plan to mark your progress.**
*   **Prefer `const` over `let`** for variable declarations by default.
*   **Use descriptive variable names** (e.g., `isLoading`, `isFeatureXYZEnabled`).
*   **Use the `is` prefix on all boolean variables**
*   **Word boolean variables so that `false` is the default value**
*   **When creating new files and folders use `kabob-case-nameing-conventions`.**
