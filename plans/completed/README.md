# Completed Steps

This directory tracks the completion status projects in the jlj2-users repository.

## Overview

## Completion Criteria

A step is considered complete when:
- All code for the step has been implemented
- All unit tests (Vitest) pass
- All integration tests (Playwright) pass, if applicable
- Code has been reviewed and meets quality standards
- Success criteria from the step's plan document are met
