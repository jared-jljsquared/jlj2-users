# Plans Directory

This directory contains the implementation plans for all work contemplated in the jlj2-users application.

Before any work is done within this codebase, a plan should be created within this directory.

When plans are completed, the plan's markdown file should be moved to the completed folder. The filename should use the plan step name (e.g. JLJ-01-step-18-security-hardening.md). Completion dates are tracked in the completed README table.
