# Plans Directory

This directory contains the implementation plans for all work contemplated in the jlj2-users application.

Before any work is done within this codebase, a plan should be created within this directory.

When plans are completed, the plan's markdown file should be moved to the completed folder, and its name should be prefixed with a date string representing the time it was completed.

See [completed/README.md](./completed/README.md) for the list of completed plans.
